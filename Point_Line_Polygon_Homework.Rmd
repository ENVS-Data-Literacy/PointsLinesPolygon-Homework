## Questions

Use the information from all the above sources to answer the following questions.  I do not want to see any raw `R` output, please wrap it all within markdown using textual, graphical, and/or tabular responses.

1. In which Zoning District is Monroe Park located and what is the area of that district.

2. Create a map of the area enclosed by N Belvidere St, East Broad St, and I-95.  Within this area, show the streets, but not alleys.

3. What kind of Zoning Districts are within this area?  Make a table showing category & area.

4. Download the Richmond School shapefile above and make a table of all the schools that are within 1000 ft of any highways in Richmond, Virginia.

5. How many zoning districts are enclosed within the boundaries of the Monroe Park Campus?  Give the area of each.
